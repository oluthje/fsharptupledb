Records will be stored in pages of size 4096. Records are inserted into a file by RBFM.

2. Record Format
|num_attrs|null_flags|end_offset_1|end_offset_2|...|end_offset_|f_1|f_2|...|f_n|

2. Page Format
Pages will have records compacted into the top of the page, with slot directory compacted to the bottom of the page.

|record_1|record_2|...|record_n|free space|record_n offset|record_n length|...|record_2 offset|record_2 length|record_1 offset|record_1 length|num_records|free space offset|

Number of pages in a file is determined by taking total number of bytes and dividing by page size

Record is forwarded if offset is negative, which means instead of reading offset and length, read PageNum and SlotNum to find forwarded record.

Record Deletion: To delete a record, set both offset and length in slot directory to 0.
